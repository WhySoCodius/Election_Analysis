# Election_Analysis


## Project Overview
A **Colorado Board of Elections** employee has given you the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local
congressional election.
Colardo team wants us to deliver the below information based on the election data collected in [election_results](/Resources/election_results.csv):
1. The total number of votes cast.
2. Complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. The total number of votes each candidate received.
4. The percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. The winner of the election based on popular vote.

After the results were drawn we need to write it in file [election_analysis](/analysis/election_analysis.txt)

## Resources
- Data Source: [election_results](/Resources/election_results.csv)
- Software: Python 3.9.12, Visual Studio Code, 1.67.1 (Universal)


## Election-Audit Results:
The analvsis of the election show that:

## Election-Audit Summary:
  In this analysis, Python was used to build algorithms that help with election results verification and analysis. When dealing with large amounts of data, Excel can become cumbersome and slow down the processing. Python and databases come in handy in this case. 
Elections are vital for the country, and the accuracy and efficiency with which they are calculated are critical.

   - Further this scipt can be modified to get state-wise results of the election in order to plan the future campains.
   - Not just for Elections, we can use the same code with different classes and lists in Schools, Colleges, and Universities to calculate grades, students, classes, lectures etc.
